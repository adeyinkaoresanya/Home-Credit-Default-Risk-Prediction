# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that will predict clients' repayment abilities to ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
